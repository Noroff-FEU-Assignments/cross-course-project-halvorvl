This was a cross course project done during the first year of studying FrontEnd Development at NOROFF

## Description

This project started out as very simple HTML project and evolved in to a more complex project as we where working through the different courses during my first year of studying FrontEnd Development at NOROFF. The task was to make a functional webpage for shop selling raincoats. This is still a work in progress, so I will continue to make changes to project as I have the time.
